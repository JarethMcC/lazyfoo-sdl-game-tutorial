Lazy Foo' C++ SDL Tutorial Journey
This repository documents my progress as I work through the "Lazy Foo' Productions" C++ SDL tutorials. The code here is a direct implementation of the lessons and serves as a personal log of my journey through the series.

About This Repository
The primary purpose of this repo is to track my personal learning and practice with SDL. Each commit or series of commits will generally correspond to a specific tutorial in the series.

For anyone interested in learning SDL from a fantastic resource, I highly recommend checking out the official tutorials:

Feel free to browse the code, but all credit for the structure and concepts goes to Lazy Foo'.
